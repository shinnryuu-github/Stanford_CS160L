# Problem 1: The More Simple Problem

## Problem

Imagine you have a super exciting book that contains a lot of words, and you want to know which words are the most common in the book. Can you write a program in C++ that reads the book, counts the number of occurrences of each word, and prints the results to the console, so you can check which words are the most common in your book?

## Input

A text file called "words.txt" that contains multiple lines of text from your super exciting book.

## Output

A list of words and their respective number of occurrences in the book, one word per line.

## Note

The output should be case-sensitive, words in uppercase and lowercase should be treated as distinct words.

With this question prompt, you are expected to use `std::ifstream`,`std::getlin`, and `std::stringstream` to read the book, extract each word, and count the occurrences of each word. Have fun with it!
